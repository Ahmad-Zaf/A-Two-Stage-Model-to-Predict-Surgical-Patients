OVERVIEW

The rising healthcare costs and increasing demand for medical services highlight the need for efficient use of healthcare resources. A key challenge is the uncertainty in patientsâ€™ resource requirements, which often leads to inefficiencies in the care delivery process.

This project aims to address that challenge by:

ðŸ”¹ Classifying patients into similar resource usage groups using electronic patient records.

ðŸ”¹ Developing a two-stage classification model that reduces variability in patientsâ€™ resource requirements.

ðŸ”¹ Applying Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis, which is particularly well-suited for healthcare data because:

It naturally handles interactions between predictor variables

It is non-parametric and less affected by dimensionality

It identifies key patient attributes that explain resource variability

Key insights include:

1) Important covariates such as procedure code, admission point, and operating surgeon explain up to 53.43% of the variability in patientsâ€™ length of stay (LoS).

2) By reducing uncertainty in LoS predictions, the model enables better patient flow management, improved throughput, and more efficient use of hospital resources
